# Object-Recognition
Application Description
My application recognizes traffic signs from video clips using Haar classifiers, grayscale conversion, and the OpenCV library. Haar classifiers are used to detect and locate traffic signs within the video frames. The captured images are converted to grayscale to facilitate the detection process, and the OpenCV library handles image processing and recognition algorithms.

Future Plans
In the future, I plan to implement a similar project to detect objects in the environment using glasses equipped with a camera. The camera will capture images and transmit them to a mobile application, which will then provide auditory feedback to users. This will assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings more effectively.
